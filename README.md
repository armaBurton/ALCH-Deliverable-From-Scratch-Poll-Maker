## HTML Setup
6 buttons
- option A add button
  - Why? ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Add event listener to increment the vote count for option A in the current poll
- option B add button
  - Why? ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Add event listener to increment the vote count for option B in the current poll
- option A subtract/undo button
  - Why? ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Add event listener to decrement the vote count for option A in the current poll
- option B subtract/undo buttons
  - Why? ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ Add event listener to decrement the vote count for option B in the current poll
- create poll form
  - Why? Add 'submit' listener to (not a click listener) to the form itself!
  - three inputs (question, option 1, option 2)
    - Why? Figure out the user's question and options
    - Why? ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ On submit, update the current poll question and options, and reflect that in the DOM
- 1 'close poll' button
  - Why?
    - ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ 
    - Append the current poll to the past polls state []
    - "Update the list"
      - clear DOM of the list
      - Use a for loop to loop through all past polls, create some DOM and display each past poll in the list
    - Clear out/reset current poll state and DOM.
- current poll section
  - Why? a bunch of empty divs that we will inject state into (question, options, and vote totals)
- empty div for closed polls history/list (for appending to)
  - Why? A place to put the histry
